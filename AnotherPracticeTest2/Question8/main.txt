Both bubble sort and insertion sort have a worst case runtime of O(n^2), but they have different best case runtimes.
Insertion sort is generally faster because if the given list is partially sorted the insertion sort could sort the list faster than O(n^2) because the insertion sort
ends once all elements are sorted. Bubble sort will sort the list in O(n^2) regardless if the list is partially sorted because the bubble sort ends only after the sort
has finished all its iterations. In general they are similar but in the case of a partially sorted list the insertion sort will sort faster than the bubble sort.
